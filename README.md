## Reflection

- **What was easy?** Recreating the layout with HTML structure.
- **What was difficult?** Matching Figma spacing and responsiveness and centering the the plus sign.
- **Approach?** Used Flexbox and media queries for layout and responsiveness for the plus sing used absolut positioning and item-align , justify-content for centering.
