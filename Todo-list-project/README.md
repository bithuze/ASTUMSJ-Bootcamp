##  Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 


## My Approach

I started by creating a simple HTML layout with an input, a button, and a list.
- Then I wrote JavaScript to:
  - Add new tasks to an array
  - Display tasks on the page
  - Mark tasks as done using a checkbox
  - Remove tasks with a delete button
- I used `localStorage` to save and load tasks so they stay even after the page is refreshed.
- I kept everything readable, clean, and easy to understand .
